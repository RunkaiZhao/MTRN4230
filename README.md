Robotics
The course introduces students to the analysis and use of robot manipulators, by exposing them to the theoretical basis of robotics as well as their practical implementation. By the end of the course students are expected to understand the ways in which robots are used in industrial and service applications; the key parameters for selecting robots for industrial applications; the main categories of robot frames of reference; and the essentials of robot kinematics, dynamics, control and path planning. Major projects require students to apply the theory to integrate a robot manipulator, simulation software, vision system and safety system to demonstrate the operation of a robot cell. Problem solving, project management and group work skills are developed throughout the semester as a foundation for graduate positions.
